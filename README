This compiler does not do typechecking. I got about 3/4 through that before it became such a ridiculous bloated mess that I simply deleted it and sacrificed those marks in order to finish the project at all.

It does not compile all J-- files, notably recursive ones, or files that are too long.


To make and run a testfile, simply copy the test file's contents (from folder t) into the file 'test.jmm' in the project's root directory, save it, then type 
>make
in a console -> this runs the test as well.

To just build the compiler itself, type 
>make compiler
instead.

To build the compiler and the testfile, but not actually run the test, type 
>make full

To run the test manually after doing previous, type
>make runtest

Assembly output of the testfile is in test.s.
All test files are in the folder 't'.
Runtime system is in rts.s
Assembled objects are rts.o and test.o
Linked ARM binary is test.exe
Compiler is jmm.exe
File containing J-- input to be compiled into ARM is in 'test.jmm'. Usage for this file is at top of README.
